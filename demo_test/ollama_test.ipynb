    "    What is Personal Color?\n",
    "    Personal color is about finding the colors that look best on you, based on your skin tone, hair, and eyes. It helps people choose clothes and makeup that make them look their best. There are 12 main personal color types, and they fall into four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Each season is divided into three different types based on how warm, cool, soft, or bright the colors look on you.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Four Seasons and Their Types\n",
    "    Spring (Warm and Bright Colors)\n",

    "\n",
    "    Light Summer: Light, cool, and soft colors like soft pink or sky blue.\n",
    "    Cool Summer: Cool, soft, and fresh colors, like lavender or cool pink.\n",

    "\n",

    "    How to Classify People’s Personal Colors by Looking at Them?\n",
    "    Check Their Skin Tone:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Warm Tone: Skin looks more golden or yellow. These people usually look best in warm colors like gold, yellow, and warm browns.\n",
    "    Cool Tone: Skin looks more pink or bluish. They look good in cool colors like silver, blue, and purple.\n",
    "    Check Their Hair Color:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Warm Hair Colors: Hair that looks golden, red, or warm brown usually fits warm tones.\n",
    "    Cool Hair Colors: Hair that looks black, dark brown, or ashy fits cool tones.\n",
    "    Check Their Eye Color:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Warm Eyes: Eyes with golden, hazel, or warm brown colors suit warm tones.\n",
    "    Cool Eyes: Blue, gray, or dark brown eyes fit cool tones.\n",
    "    Look at Brightness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bright Features: If someone’s skin, hair, and eyes are clear and bright, they might look best in bright colors (Bright Spring or Bright Winter).\n",
    "    Soft Features: If their features look more muted or gentle, they might suit soft colors (Soft Summer or Soft Autumn).\n",
    "    Check Depth (Light or Dark):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Light: If their features are light (light skin, light hair), they usually look better in lighter colors like pale pink or sky blue (Light Spring or Light Summer).\n",
    "    Deep: If they have darker skin, hair, or eyes, deep colors like dark red or navy may be best (Deep Autumn or Deep Winter).\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Let’s say you are looking at a photo of someone. They have light blonde hair, blue eyes, and skin that looks a little pinkish. You might think:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Their cool skin and blue eyes suggest they look good in cool colors.\n",
    "    Their light hair and soft skin tone suggest they need soft or light colors.\n",
    "    So, they might be a Light Summer. Light, cool, and soft colors like light blue or soft pink would look great on them!\n",
